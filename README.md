# Employee_Management_System

The main objective of this project is to implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations. These operations will be performed on a database, allowing the user to add new data, read existing data, modify data, and delete data. The CRUD operations form the backbone of most database-driven applications, making it essential to implement them correctly. By integrating these operations into the project, users will be able to interact with the database and perform necessary tasks easily and efficiently.
